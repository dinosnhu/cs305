### Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial company that makes international transactions. The company wanted me to audit their code and improve the security of their code and the company in general.

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? 
I documented the vulnerabilities very well and produced a report for Artemis Financial.

### Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
If we didn't code securely, software could be exploited. We could be risking the privacy of millions of people and we could cost the company a lot of time and money. They may also be legal consequences if we aren't careful and ethical.

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The challenging part was finding false positives, as it took a lot of time and work to figure out whether something actually affected the codebase or not.

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ran Dependency Check multiple times and ensured that there were no new vulnerabilities once the initial ones were audited. The code was refactored to ensure that it was updated and secure.

After the code was refactored, I did another vulnerability assessement and ran Dependency Check to ensure that there were no new vulnerabilities.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Dependency Check is great for auditing code. A good coding practice to follow is encapsulation to ensure that everyone has limited access. Another good practice is to minimize dependencies, as the more dependencies a program has, the larger its attack vector is.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
This shows employers that I have some knowledge about secure coding practices and know how to use tools such as Dependency Check to audit Java code.
